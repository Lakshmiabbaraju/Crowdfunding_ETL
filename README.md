# Crowdfunding_ETL
--------------------------------------------
Project Overview
----------------------

This project involves building an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for crowdfunding data using Python, Pandas, and PostgreSQL. The goal is to extract data from two Excel files (crowdfunding.xlsx and contacts.xlsx), transform the data into a structured format, and load it into a PostgreSQL database. The project also involves generating CSV files, creating an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), and developing a table schema for the database.

Transformed the data and clean it for database insertion.

Created and populated a PostgreSQL database.

Exported the transformed data into CSV files.
