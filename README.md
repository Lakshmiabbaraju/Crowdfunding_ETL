# Crowdfunding_ETL

Project Overview
This project involves building an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for crowdfunding data using Python, Pandas, and PostgreSQL. The goal is to extract data from two Excel files (crowdfunding.xlsx and contacts.xlsx), transform the data into a structured format, and load it into a PostgreSQL database. The project also involves generating CSV files, creating an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), and developing a table schema for the database.

Key Tasks:
Create DataFrames for categories, subcategories, campaigns, and contacts.
Transform the data and clean it for database insertion.
Create and populate a PostgreSQL database.
Export transformed data into CSV files.
Design the database schema and ERD.
Use PostgreSQL to store and manage the data.
